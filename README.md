This is a beginner attempt at HTML and CSS formatting. 

I have already tried a few very basic index pages but they were lost on my old machine and were extremely simple.

Having finished this my understanding of the use of grid instead of flex is better, though I keep forgetting about the <nav> element and have simply done links as the menu. 
  Was a fun project.
